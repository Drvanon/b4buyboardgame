# B4BUY - The Board Game

## Backstory
The nascent lands of nascent-landia have been under attack from vinkingistan for
many years now.  A new generation of leaders has risen up to bring an end to
these attacks and build up a strong economy. However, who will become the king
of this nascent-landia is still to be decided.
Will this generation be able to conquer the vikistinians and more importantly
their own lust for power?

## The board
The board consists of colored hexagons with numbers on them. The color of the
hexagon represents a resource, the number on it determines the output value of
the tile.

## The setup
At the beginning of the game all of the players are awarded a certain amount of
money. The tiles are spread out randomly, but in the shape of a hexagon.

## The game play
### Markings on the board
At the start of every turn the tiles that will be attacked are marked by
throwing the dice. (Every tile has an equal chance of getting hit. TODO: think
of a mechanism that accomplishes this.)

### The income phase
Every round starts with each player getting the number of resources specified on
each tile in his possession. Also every player receives 3 building plans from
the general stockpile.

### The building effect phase
All buildings will apply their effects.

### The trade phase
During this phase there is a free for all in trade. Everything can be offered
and accepted. Tiles, buildings, power-points and armies are all tradable for money.

### The build phase
All players are again allowed to use their resources to build the plans that
they own. After this phase ends the player is allowed to store his remaining
plans in the his plan store. If the amount of plans the player has more plans
than slots in his plan store, he will have to discard those plans. 

### The placing phase
In this phase all players are allowed to place their buildings.

### The attacking phase
The vikingistinians will attack tiles that are marked.

## End of the game
When the players have managed to stave off the vikingistinians for X attacks the
amount of power of all players is compared and the one with the most will be the
new king of nascent-landia.
