# Buildings
These ideas are not categorized at all.

## Color specific
Some buildings will allow for the players to start getting plans from new
plan-stockpiles.

## Military
One player will have to start specializing towards military. The cost of
building these buildings will have a negative effect on the tile that they are
on.

## Power
There will be several buildings that give power to the player that owns it. Some
buildings will be more purpose oriented and others power oriented.

## Vikingians
A card can make the price of getting attacked worse: for example if the tile
that this building has been placed on gets defeated, pay 3 wool.
